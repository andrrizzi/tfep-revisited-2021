## Manifest

- `sn2_vacuum/`: Include the input files to run the reference simulation of the SN2 reaction example. The files saved when executing the TFEP analysis of this system are also saved in this folder.
- `scripts/`: Driving scripts and libraries used to implement the method and run the examples.
